*date*    : 03/2022

*version* : 1.0	

the Connect 4 game, which is played with a vertical grid of 6x7 seven
vertical grid of seven columns by six rows. Each player has twenty-one tokens of one color
color (most often red and yellow, translated in our example by the characters "O" and "X" places them in the grid in turn.
To win the game, a player must line up four chips vertically, horizontally or obliquely.  It is the same principle as Tic-Tac-Toe with one difference: the grid is
vertical, which means that the chips fall to the bottom of the column chosen by the player. For
more details, I refer you to the dedicated article on Wikipedia .
